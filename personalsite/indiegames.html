            AAA game studios don't always get it right, from the way Bethesda monetized Fallout 76, to the absolute flop that was Blizzard removing Overwatch from the libraries of people who owned it and releasing the new pay-to-play Overwatch 2, it seems there is always something to be desired. Indie game developers create amazing stories with minimal resources and usually sell their games for much cheaper prices.
          </p>
          <p>Despite how much I love my Bethesda games, it's incredibly important to support indie developers and their craft, not just because they deserve it, but also to push for better quality work in AAA companies. The best way to remind these companies of the quality we as customers are looking for is to back projects that are striving for that quality.</p>
          <p>With that being said, let's discuss some indie games in the current sphere that paved the way for future developers.</p>
          <p>First of all, it would be a mistake to skip talking about Five Night's At Freddy's. Love it or hate it, it opened the door for THOUSANDS of indie developers to start being recognized for their work.</p>
          <p>Scott Cawthon was a struggling developer before he began work on the FNAF series. He developed games, but always got less than pleased feedback. After 20 years of making games, he was ready to throw in the towel, but decided to take one last stab at making games by using the negative criticism he'd gotten about his character designs to make something MEANT to be scary. Today, almost 10 years after the release of the first game, the franchise is still one of the biggest success stories in indie development.</p>

            <p>Only a year later, the game Undertale made by indie developer Toby Fox would release, also to critical acclaim. Both of these indie games turned into HUGE successes in a relatively short period of time, paving the way for other indie developers to begin to show their work.</p>
            <p>In more recent works by indie developers, you might recognize names like Hollow Knight, Among Us, Stardew Valley, or Celeste. You might even recognize the best selling video game in the world...</p>
            <img src="images/minecraft.jpg" alt="image for page3">
            <p>I say all of this to say I think that indie developers NEED to be encouraged and acknowledged, and as I add more entries to this site, I intend to spend a lot of time talking about indie developers and their work. The amazing things a small team or even one person can do deserve recognition!</p>
