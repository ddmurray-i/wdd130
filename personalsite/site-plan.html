      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To make a gaming blog where I can share my gaming discoveries, be it easter eggs in a game, an analysis of a character arc, or fan content.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>With my color scheme and my general taste in games I would expect this site to appeal most to young adults. I have a fair number of games I play that are older games that not many people talk about, so I would expect to attract an audience of adults in their 50s to 60s as well because I can cater to them in the sense that it is rare to find people talking about the other games I play.<p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        Welcome to my gaming blog! I plan to expand this to be a fully searchable wealth of knowledge on all the games I play. I am known as a game completionist in my circles, so I've had the chance to find many easter eggs and cool mods I'd love to share with others! I like to program games in my spare time, so as time goes on I might just create an entry for that. Stay tuned!
      </p>
      <p>
        While I'm playing, I find a ton of things I want to share with others aside from the things I deem important, things like funny bugs or screenshots of interesting finds. I plan on sharing those in their respective categories, too! As I continue in creating things for the various games I play, I will be sure to keep this blog updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        To close out this page, here are a few screenshots of funny things I've found in one of my favorites, Fallout 4.
      </p>

        <p>He clipped through the staircase. Sucks to be him, I guess.</p>
        <img src="images/ghoul-stuck.png" alt="ghoul in rubble pile">
        <p>Bethesda has certainly made a name for themselves in having some of the buggiest games out there. Don't get me wrong! I love their games. I'm an avid enjoyer of the Fallout series and I LOVED Skyrim, but...</p>
        <p>Speaking of Skyrim, I feel like we don't give the art team enough credit for the work they did on the surroundings.</p>
        <img src="images/skyrim-moon.png" alt="skyrim moon">
        <p>I took that shot while running away from a bear! Yeah, not exactly as serene as it looks, but what can I say? I love the work they did on the environment.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Fallout Content</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my page where I focus entirely on the Fallout franchise and the misery the lore has brought into my life. I have spent far too long in this fanbase to not have opinions, ideas, and excessive knowledge on the backstory.
      </p>
      <p>I ALSO know I'm not the only one thrilled to hear that the next Fallout game will be taking place somewhere outside of the USA! I know it's an alternate universe and all, but I absolutely have theories on what's coming next in the series based on things we learn in some of the more recent installments. But we can get back to that later! For now, let's go over some of the Easter eggs you can find in Fallout if you're willing to do a bit of exploring. I won't be going into any that are really valuable just yet as I'd like to spend more time on those and give instructions on how to find them. :)</p>
      <p>Images for Fallout Content</p>
        <img src="images/rsz_1amontillado.png" alt="the cask of amontillado... 400 years later.">
        <p>If you've ever read The Cask of Amontillado, this one is probably going to give you a laugh, but it's actually referring to a bit of history! In Fallout 4, you're able to find an old, run down castle. This is actually Fort Independence in Boston, the place where Edgar Allen Poe initially heard a story that gave him the inspiration to write his tale. At the time, he was stationed there as a private. Therefore, in the basement of Fort Independence in game, you can find a few bottles of wine labelled as Amontillado, and a man built into a brick wall. Macabre, but VERY cool if you ask me. </p>
        <p>This one is for any Dr. Who fans out there. In Fallout New Vegas, you can find an NCR Emergency Radio broadcast that makes a reference to the fine doctor himself and the network its played on. The line in question is "Bravo Bravo Charlie, the Doctor is coming." You might also find that some Securitrons you have to take out yell "EXTERMINATE" while shooting at you. Here's looking at you, Daleks.</p>
        <img src="images/the-kings.png" alt="the front entrance for the kings group in Fallout New Vegas">
        <p>Finally, Elvis Presley. No, I'm not kidding. The group "The Kings" in Fallout New Vegas is a group of Elvis impersonators, but... it's been 200 years since the war, so they have NO idea who Elvis is, and they also have no clue about his nickname. All they know is that, as The Kings, they feel they need to take care of the local people in an honorable fashion. They found some old notes, they never exactly say HOW they found these notes, but the notes taught them how to dress down to the way they slick back their hair, and how to talk.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Indie Games</h3>
      <p>
        AAA game studios don't always get it right, from the way Bethesda monetized Fallout 76, to the absolute flop that was Blizzard removing Overwatch from the libraries of people who owned it and releasing the new pay-to-play Overwatch 2, it seems there is always something to be desired. Indie game developers create amazing stories with minimal resources and usually sell their games for much cheaper prices.
      </p>
      <p>Despite how much I love my Bethesda games, it's incredibly important to support indie developers and their craft, not just because they deserve it, but also to push for better quality work in AAA companies. The best way to remind these companies of the quality we as customers are looking for is to back projects that are striving for that quality.</p>
      <p>With that being said, let's discuss some indie games in the current sphere that paved the way for future developers.</p>
      <p>Images for Indie Games</p>
      <p>First of all, it would be a mistake to skip talking about Five Night's At Freddy's. Love it or hate it, it opened the door for THOUSANDS of indie developers to start being recognized for their work.</p>
      <p>Scott Cawthon was a struggling developer before he began work on the FNAF series. He developed games, but always got less than pleased feedback. After 20 years of making games, he was ready to throw in the towel, but decided to take one last stab at making games by using the negative criticism he'd gotten about his character designs to make something MEANT to be scary. Today, almost 10 years after the release of the first game, the franchise is still one of the biggest success stories in indie development.</p>
        <img src="images/undertale.png" alt="undertale logo">
        <p>Only a year later, the game Undertale made by indie developer Toby Fox would release, also to critical acclaim. Both of these indie games turned into HUGE successes in a relatively short period of time, paving the way for other indie developers to begin to show their work.</p>
        <p>In more recent works by indie developers, you might recognize names like Hollow Knight, Among Us, Stardew Valley, or Celeste. You might even recognize the best selling video game in the world...</p>
        <img src="images/minecraft.jpg" alt="image for page3">
        <p>I say all of this to say I think that indie developers NEED to be encouraged and acknowledged, and as I add more entries to this site, I intend to spend a lot of time talking about indie developers and their work. The amazing things a small team or even one person can do deserve recognition!</p>

      <h3>Fallout Content</h3>
      <p>         
        Idea for header has to do with a big mishmash of the generations of Fallout in a lineup, won't necessarily include all but will definitely do a decent rundown of my favorites by generation.

      <h3>Indie Games</h3>
      <p>         
        Idea for header has to do with some of the top indie games of the last several years. Will focus on games people are more likely to recognize as indie games (such as games that aren't Minecraft) but that are also popular enough to be recognized by most people who have played video games and have a basic understanding of indie games. Ideas for games so far: Hollow Knight, Undertale, Stardew Valley, Inscryption, Superhot. Will have to pick 3 of these with the most recognizable graphics to use with the best up front and others to the side being split by the front.
