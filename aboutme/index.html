    <h2>DeLynn Murray</h2>
    <h2>Ace/Delta</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm DeLynn, but depending on the social circle you catch me in, you might know me as Ace or Delta. I tend to go by Ace amongst work friends, they picked the nickname out for me because of how quickly and accurately I got things done. I go by Delta in all of my online spaces as a creator, be that in my programming spaces or otherwise.

    <p>I'm pursuing a degree in data analytics. I'm currently in my senior year. This class wasn't necessarily required for my degree, but I wanted to get a little better in my HTML and CSS skills, so I decided it was the class for me!</p>
    <p>BYU-I has been an amazing experience for me so far. I transferred here from a local college after I finished my AA degree. At first I was skeptical, but I've truly come to love the amazing people I've met here and I've grown to appreciate the environment I'm surrounded by. Feel free to reach out if you need any help with anything! I learn best through teaching and would love to help you progress this semester.
