    <h2>DeLynn Murray</h2>
    <h2>Ace/Delta</h2>
    <h2>Introduction from 2023 below!</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm DeLynn, but depending on the social circle you catch me in, you might know me as Ace or Delta. I tend to go by Ace amongst work friends, they picked the nickname out for me because of how quickly and accurately I got things done. I go by Delta in all of my online spaces as a creator, be that in my programming spaces or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>I'm pursuing a degree in data analytics. I'm currently in my senior year. This class wasn't necessarily required for my degree, but I wanted to get a little better in my HTML and CSS skills, so I decided it was the class for me!</p>
    <p>BYU-I has been an amazing experience for me so far. I transferred here from a local college after I finished my AA degree. At first I was skeptical, but I've truly come to love the amazing people I've met here and I've grown to appreciate the environment I'm surrounded by. Feel free to reach out if you need any help with anything! I learn best through teaching and would love to help you progress this semester.
    </p>
    <h2 style= text-align: center>And now! I actually introduce myself.</h2>

    <p>Hey, I'm Ace or Delta or DeLynn or whatever it is you decide to call me :) I'm a 20 yr old data science major. This was all from my very first semester of HTML, and while I haven't had a ton of reasons to use HTML since taking this class, I certainly have used it.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://ddmurray-i.github.io/valentinescard/valentine/">I mean, come on. Who doesn't like Valentine's Day cards? :)</a></p>
    <p>These days I focus more on data science. Which is cool, for the record! People like to give me flack about it, but I love what I do. One of my most important projects I actually finished at 18 to raise awareness for mental health in the United States. It isn't my prettiest graph to date, I've had more time to practice, but I still find the visuals impactful and important to me, as a reminder of where I'd like to take my career from here in terms of helping others.</p>

    <p>I've always been a huge lover of video games and the creative arts, as well as a HUGE proponent of music. I work with vocal synths in my downtime (which... let's be honest. I make downtime so I can play with my vocal synths.)</p>

    <p>This requires an understanding of MIDI software and takes some SERIOUS time. I love my work, though, and so I keep at it!</p>
    <p>I'll let you go now :) I know you're probably pretty busy! If you have any questions PLEASE feel free to reach out at delynnmurray@gmail.com. Happy to be here!</p>
